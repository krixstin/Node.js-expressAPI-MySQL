# Node.js-expressAPI-MySQL
API on Node.js Express server &amp; MySQL database connection


## Summary of Node.js Lab
It was very helpful to grasp a core idea on how to build a Node.js application. I learned how to construct and map directories for projects. I was able to install 4 different dependencies(body-parser, express, mysql & request) and use them throught out the project by callling them in a proper .js file. Following the given document file, I set up an express server, an HTTP server and routes, conenected to MySQL and succcesfully received API data from it. Also, using URL parameters and sending POST requests through index.html taught me how the inside of API structure and is working. I had to keep reminding myself to restart the server after changes and open one at a time. Now, I'm more familar with npm commands to start a server and modifying .json files.
